## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [Node.js and npm](nodejs.org) Node >= 4.x.x, npm >= 2.x.x

### Developing

When you are using ionic serve you run your app as a website. So cordova won't be available. Thus leading to the error you are getting

You can bypass this in several ways.

First you could use the following to run it on the browser with cordova

1. `ionic cordova platform add browser`
2. `ionic cordova run browser` 
3. and run it on the browser `http://localhost:8000`


Second you could test this natively (or using an emulator) by issuing

1. `ionic cordova platform add <ios/android>`
1. `ionic cordova run <android/ios> <--device>`
--device if you are using a physical device or not if you intend to use an emulator. Of course this will require the JAVA SDK, ANDROID SDK and Gradle
